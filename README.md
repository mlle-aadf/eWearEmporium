## Home Page :house:



Our home page features the hero section of our website, which includes our slogan: “Empower your everyday with wearable technology”.



In order to make our users’ experience simple but enjoyable when browsing our e-commerce website, we’ve created a navbar which will lead our clients directly to parts of our website our customers will be interested in.

## Shop All :eyes:



In this page, you’ll be able to view all of the products that we have to offer at **E-Wear Emporium**. 



You’ll even be able to sort through the items according to your liking. For example, you can sort through the various categories of our products, you can sort through our items by alphabetical order or you can even sort our products by their prices. 



In addition, users will also be able to see if the products they wish to purchase is in stock or not. Of course, should the item be unavailable for transaction, they will not be able to add those items in their cart. 


### Our Cart Feature :shopping_cart:



Our cart feature enables our customers to add items to a list that they would like to purchase, but that's not all. They will also be able to view each product's price tag and how many quantities of each item they've inserted in their cart. 

However, to simplify our user interface, the cart feature won't lead them to a separate browser tab. Instead, a small window pop-up will appear where they can see all the information previously mentioned, but also be able to keep surfing through our products at the same time. 



### Order Confirmed! :white_check_mark:



Moreover, once users would like to finalize their purchase, they simply have to click the _Checkout_, which will lead them to a confirmation page for users to verify their cart before confirming their purchase.  

Lastly, once our clients have confirmed their transaction, they will be redirected to a _Success_ page to confirm their order has been placed successfully. But that's not all; their order #ID will also be displayed on the page, should they have any questions or concerns in regards to their order.
